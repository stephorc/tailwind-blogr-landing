### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of Tailwind classes, including flex, positioning, and transitions.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
